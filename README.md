# STM32-Bare-Metal
A basic seat allocation system was designed that senses if a seat is occupied using force sensitive resistors, results relayed through using I2C communication + ADC modules to the STM that displays the prototype
Timers and Interrupt Vectoring was used to put the STM processor in and out of sleep mode to save power and inctrease efficiency
